# ocaml_starter
Minimal Dune project for learning Ocaml.

## Instructions

- Do ```eval $(opam env)``` 

- Install the test system with ```opam install ppx_inline_test```

- Add code and tests in the ```*.ml``` files and make more of them if you like.

- ```dune runtest`` to run the tests.

- ```dune utop`` to enter interactive toplevel. Now you can 
access your module functions with ```MyLibrary.More_code.fibonacci```. Note that more_code has been capitalized to denote a module.
